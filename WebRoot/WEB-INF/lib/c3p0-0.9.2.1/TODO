-- in-use locking of NewPooledConnections ResourcePool.Manager tasks in C3P0PooledConnectionPool is 
   unnecessary and hard to reason aboout in light of NewPooledConnection locks, pool semantics
   enforce exclusive use by maintenance tasks, there is no need to re-enforce exclusive access at all
   (delayed until after 0.9.2 release only because things are stable and I'd want this further tested
   before showing up in a final release)

-- undo hackish reflective delgation of JDBC4 PreparedStatement methods once we build against JDBC4 libs

-- it would be insanely easy to get rid of the recursiveness in BasicResourcePool.checkoutResource( ... ).
   worth doing? it's tail-recursive, best to just wait 'til that's optimized in Java?
